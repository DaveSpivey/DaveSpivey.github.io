I have a sorta website! Here's a link: [GitHub site](http://davespivey.github.io/index.html)

- What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

Wow, a lot. Margin was the hardest to figure out most of the time, because it doesn't always act the way I think it will. Depending on the element's position, adding margin increments to a side may or may not move the element in the direction I want. I didn't use padding in this challenge, although now that I think about it, I moved text within divs by setting position to relative and adding "top" value etc. to push the text down. In the future I'll use padding, because that's kind of what it's for.

- What did you learn about CSS positioning?

More than I already knew, but I still don't have it nailed. Static and fixed are pretty straightforward, but I found it hard keeping track of whether I wanted absolute or relative for certain elements and I ended up getting it wrong on the first try most of the time - even when I tried to really think it through before rendering it to try it out. I ended up using relative most of the time, probably more than I should. I feel like getting a better hold on absolute will be important as I train myself to be more 'responsive design' aware, as it places an element in the context of its parent elements.

- What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest parts were text styling and making minute changes to adjust the look of individual elements. The hardest part was in the broad strokes. I spent lots of time trying to move blocks of elements - divs with other elements inside etc. - in relation to the other things on the page. This is where I usually got frustrated with it because it rarely did what I wanted on the first try.

- What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned how to resize an image without distorting it! I learned that when in doubt, be specific with id's and classes in HTML so that one stylesheet doesn't have ghost effects on sections and mains and h1 etc that takes you forever to find. I also learned that if you're gonna try to make a color scheme for a page you should turn of f.lux, otherwise every color you pick has been blue-filtered and will look hideous with the other colors.
