      <h3>Getting ready for week 3</h3>
      <p>
        This blog apparently just warped two weeks into the future. I'm reading the date I just wrote, but to me these past two weeks have seemed like one big long brain-melting day. What a crazy place -- I'm learning tons. Every once and a while I'll look over code I wrote and posted to our submission site a few days previous and think "did I actually write that?" But in a bad way, like I'm already super critical of the primitive way I was looking at a concept. This place is about cramming it into your skull, and it's fantastic.
      </p>

        My cohort is great - these are the students that started with me two weeks ago (phase 1) - as opposed to other current students, like phase 2 who started 3 weeks previous to us. The students move through the program in 3-week segments, and there are 3 of these phases plus one 'career week' to cap it off. Everyone is encouraged to roam and mingle with other cohorts, which is great because it gives us a sense of perspective on how the program progresses, and gives senior(ish) students a chance to advise and mentor newer students (which they do often, with genuine interest in our progress).
      </p>
      <p>
        The single most eye-opening and educational experience so far has been the hackathon I attended last weekend. This is a common thing in San Francisco, but this particular one was hosted by Dev Bootcamp onsite, and students, even new students, were encouraged to participate. You register, show up at 8am, drink lots of coffee, listen to people pitch ideas they've prepared for applications, form groups based on interest, then GO MAKE THING. It was pretty incredible. It's called a hackathon because it lasts all day, and into the night. Our team had an initial planning session (whiteboarding session) then we divided up tasks and just coded all day, periodically sharing files and merging them online, or regrouping and tweaking the project design. By the end of the day we had a working piece of software that would run online that took bits of raw data from a San Francisco government site, ran it through Google data for mapping, and returned an interactive map based on user input. I was trying to find a simpler way to put this, but honestly that's the best I could do because whoa! did it seem more complicated than necessary.

      <p>
        Mostly it was great just to get a feel for how teams work these things out. Everyone in my team was either a professional or a recent grad of Dev Bootcamp (I guess that's pretty much the same) but they made me feel so welcome and really took the time to loop me in on stuff that was over my head. So glad I went, even if it meant falling a little behind on work, and maybe a lot behind on sleep.

      <p>Here's an action-packed shot of my team MAKING THING</p>

        You can't even tell they're saving the world...

        Here's one more shot of the space to give you an idea.
      </p>

        Kind of open-officey, but also plants and a wall that's one big whiteboard and yep that's a guy playing guitar. So exactly the cliche San Fran tech startup overcaffeinated realm of postive thinking you'd expect. Also, there's definitely a guy who exclusively gets around the space on an Airwheel, which is pretty much a prototype for those hoverboards.
      </p>

        One of the girls in my cohort found out it was my birthday Thursday, so she got a card and had everyone secretly sign it while I was up for a snack or whatever. Then at the end of the day they brought out a cake and everyone sang. Had no idea that was coming - made me feel like spending my whole day coding with these people wasn't a weird choice at all

        So this week we've got 'assessments' on Wednesday. If you don't do well enough you have to start over. Like start over SCHOOL, not the test. It's built in to the rolling 3-week cohort model. If anyone is dragging they stay back and join the next incoming cohort. It's a way to keep teaching to the top of the class and not worry about anyone who's not getting it. Sounds brutal but it's kind of the only way to sustain this velocity of incoming material. Apparently it happens all the time too, my cohort is only 18 people, and one of those is a roll-back from a former phase 1 cohort. So yep I'm working extra hard this week. On that note I think I'll get back to work.

        This post was long-ish just because I hadn't posted in a while, and lots of stuff has happened in the past two weeks. I'll try to post more often and focus on brief updates. Miss everyone - and thanks for reading. I'll leave you with a snapshot of my favorite visual aid from Thursday's morning lecture on "Sharing functional behavior with modules". Can you spot the behavior common to these two?

      <h2>Dave's off tickety-typing in San Francisco</h2>
      <h3>Last day of Phase 0</h3>
      <p>
        Hey everyone! Tomorrow morning I start the onsite portion of my school, <a href="www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>. I'm all moved in to my new home-for-ten-weeks in San Francisco and ready to start. I'll try to post on this page here and there as I have time, with the idea of keeping any curious readers up to date with my unconventional learning adventure.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is part of my current website, and you can see pages I created during the online portion of school, including "technical blog" posts. This blog, though, is for family and friends, and isn't linked to from anywhere in the site. I'll keep all the posts on this page, with the newest at the top so there's only one web address to keep track of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the boring stuff is out of the way, here's the view from my room:
      </p>

        It's been foggy and rainy, and it'll probably stay that way, but when it's clear enough I can see the ocean out my window. To give you an idea of where I'm staying in the city - and where my school is - here's a screenshot of a map of my commute:
      </p>
      <img src="../imgs/famblog_images/commute_screenshot.png">
      <p>
        I'm staying on the west side in the Sunset district. The joke around here is that it's so foggy you never actually see a good sunset. That route is mostly the L train, where I get on one block from my spot and it dumps me 3 blocks from the school. I'm in a really cool neighborhood - doesn't even feel like I'm in the middle of a city. There are several parks within walking distance, here's one Kate and I walked down to today:
      </p>

      <img src="../imgs/famblog_images/park3.JPG">
      <p>
        Not bad! So I'm staying with a couple who are friends of friends and airbnb their rooms out frequently. They're very welcoming and Kate is encouraged to bring Raja when she visits, so I found a good spot. Raja has made friends this weekend with the dogs who live here, Moxie and Gypsy:
      </p>

      <p>
        Gypsy is the black mutt, Moxie is the sheepdog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kate helped me get all set up for the week, including making sure I had a meal plan and groceries, so I'm good to go. I'm really excited to start all the coding madness, and I'll post again about the site with pics once I'm settled into the program. Thanks for reading!
