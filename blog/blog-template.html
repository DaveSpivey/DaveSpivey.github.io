<!--Wireframing was pretty fun with a pair. I like having input on creative things, i.e. what should go where, because it sort of reinforces instincts and conventions about design standards. My pair had been using Gliffy wireframing software, which I had never seen, so I appreciated that he showed me around the interface.
  Wireframing was definitely helpful when it was time to write HTML because the structure wasn't some abstract idea, we had already gone through and agreed upon the blueprint, so we just went down the list and knocked out HTML.
We both agreed that because we were wireframing for a blog, simplicity was the guiding virtue. Turned out very simple, and I think that's a good thing.
  I didn't learn any new semantic elements because I'd already been looking at the list for release 2.8, but I did use <main> for the first time. We discussed its use before implementing it.
